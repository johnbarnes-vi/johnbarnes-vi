## Hello!

I'm John Barnes, student of Computer Science at the University of Houston, learning Deep Learning algorithms and the frameworks used to implement them. Before this, I earned a degree in Philosophy, focusing on systems of formal logic. This blend shapes the way I approach problem-solving and think about the possibilities of technology.
